    Scenario: A simple numeral housenumber is found
        Given the places
         | osm | class    | type | housenr | geometry |
         | N1  | building | yes  | 45      | 9        |
        And the places
         | osm | class   | type | name       | geometry |
         | W10 | highway | path | North Road | 1,2,3    |
        When importing
        And sending search query "45, North Road"
        Then results contain
         | osm |
         | N1  |

        Then results contain
         | osm |
         | N1  |


    Scenario Outline: Each housenumber in a list is found
        Given the places
         | osm | class    | type | housenr | geometry |
         | N1  | building | yes  | <hnrs>  | 9        |
        And the places
         | osm | class   | type | name     | geometry |
         | W10 | highway | path | Multistr | 1,2,3    |
        When importing
        When sending search query "2 Multistr"
        Then results contain

        When sending search query "4 Multistr"
        Then results contain
         | osm |
         | N1  |
        When sending search query "12 Multistr"
        Then results contain
         | osm |
         | N1  |

     Examples:
        | hnrs |
